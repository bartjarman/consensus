          <p>Welcome to Jetan Games. We are a small game design and development company in Gilbert, Arizona. One of the most important things that we can give our families is time. That’s why we focus on making games the whole family will enjoy gathered around the table, playing together.</p>
          <h3>Why Jetan?</h3>

		  <p>When I was a teenager, my grandfather introduced me to the author Edgar Rice Burroughs and the John Carter series of books. In one of those books, the Chessmen of Mars, the author outlines a variation on chess that is played by human players on a lifesize playing field (and you thought J.K. Rowling came up with the idea). I have always loved the books, and the idea of taking a unique twist on an old classic.</p>
