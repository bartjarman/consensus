					<p>In May 2017 I first started putting together categories after watching my favorite movie of all time, The Princess Bride. The very first category I added to the game? What is the greatest movie line of all time? Of course the greatest movie line of all time is:<br>

					“My name is Indigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.” Anyone who thinks otherwise is just wrong.</p>

					<p>The first 50 or so categories were compiled that first day, and we began playing what would eventually become Consensus as a family, using lists from my phone. As teenagers, my kids kept asking to play again and again, and I had to come up with more categories. It was particularly fun when we had new friends to play with, and discovered what they thought about these pop culture topics.</p>

					<p>Finally, in 2022 I decided to quit messing around and actually make a prototype of the game. My good friend, Craig Jensen, agreed to provide some art and design, and then we added a few more categories to bring the total up to 200. We wrote down the rules that we had been using for years for the first time, and packaged it all up in a pocket size edition.</p>

					<p>We hope you enjoy it as much as we have.</p>
